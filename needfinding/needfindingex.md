Observation Exercise

For my exercise, I have my subject playing one of my favorite online card games, Legends of Runeterra. I've given them the task of creating, editing, and saving a new deck, and then taking it into a game.

As the exercise starts she immediately navigated to the play button and after selecting a deck, was able to quickly get into a match queue. Unfortunately the game's population numbers aren't what they used to be, and after waiting for about 20 seconds she cancelled the queue. She then idly clicked around the menus for a bit longer before promptly going back into the match queue. After waiting for about another 15 seconds she cancelled the queue again and gave another attempt at finding the deck creation button. After clicking around the play menu for a little while longer she queued for a match for a third time. This time the queue was short and she was whisked away into a match before she could cancel for a third time. After explaining the concept of a mulligan, I let her start her first turn and she was off to the races. She spent a few turns inspecting the cards and figuring out how to play them, after a while I gave her a few hints as to what was import to keep track of, such as mana and her health. Eventually she was able to figure out how to summon a minion and even how to equip it with an equipment! Unfortunately this wasn't enough and she was rather quickly defeated after this. After the game was over I noted that she seemed a little frustrated that she didn't know what to do with the cards or how she might realistically achieve the goal of bringing her opponent to zero health. After this, I instructed her that she still had to make a deck and so she went back to searching for that menu. After exhausting nearly every option on the play menu, she seemed to give up and start vertically clicking through the other menus, rather quickly landing on the deck collection menu. From this point on she quickly figured out how to the remainder of the tasks, such as create, add and remove cards from, as well as name her deck. There was little strategy in making her deck, really just idly adding cards to it, but this was to be expected as she had little overall understanding of the game and its strategy.

The first two of these interviews were with someone who had played online CCGs before, the last was with someone who, while proficient in using computers, had never played a CCG before.

Master Duel
1. What did you find easy to use/intuitive in the app?

+ Match start menu was intuitive.
+ Streamlined design/direction from main menu to match start.
+ Self-explanatory buttons
+ Easy to use even without prior knowledge
+ Microtransactions were easy to access (shocker)
+ In matches cards were easy to use

2. What features did you find to be difficult/less intuitive to use?

+ Deckbuilding was difficult
+ Card design was difficult to understand
+ Difficult to find cards because effects are not searchable
+ Turn structure was more complicated than necessary, overall difficult to understand what was happening when.
+ Difficult to understand what was legal and what wasn’t, more of a rules issue

3. What were your thoughts on the card design? Did they communicate information about the game effectively?

+ Overall no, some things were easy to understand, most not so much.

4. Were there any standout features? What made them more noticeable than other features in the menus?

+ Different from other competitive card games in design, menus reflected this somewhat

5. If you could change one thing about the menus, what would it be and why?

+ Make it more aesthetically pleasing, very robotic in design, sharp edges, colors or sort of harsh, not very welcoming.

Hearthstone
1. What did you find easy to use/intuitive in the app?

+ Menu layout was easy to understand
+ Buttons were very differentiated from one another in design
+ The shapes and the words were indicative of where the button would take you
+ Battle UI was very easy to understand
+ Simple board design, resources pronounced but not too prominent
+ Hovering over menu features both in battle and in regular menus displayed a pop-up giving a basic explanation
+ Center of the arena was condensed, lots of information in one general area, however, this information was simplistic so not too complex to start
+ Simple streamlined designs, most menus took you exactly where they told you with few submenus between where you wanted to go.

2. What features did you find to be difficult/less intuitive to use?

+ In terms of deck-building, it wasn’t easy to build decks based on specific effects
+ Had to have prior knowledge of how particular cards worked with one another or what cards names were.
+ Some keywords were missing. Main ones were present

3. What were your thoughts on the card design? Did they communicate information about the game effectively?

+ Meaning conveyed through the cards was done decently
+ If a card had a keyword it was displayed on the cards border on the board, allowing everyone to understand what was going on.
+ Most of the time these were easy to understand descriptions, some were harder to understand.
+ Attack and health were easy to see
+ Some cards have complex effect texts, which could be difficult to understand

4. Were there any standout features? What made them more noticeable than other features in the menus?

+ Artistic style of the menus, comfy feeling made the player feel welcome and wanting to stay awhile.
+ Appropriate theming through menus.

5. If you could change one thing about the menus, what would it be and why?

+ Allow searching of card text in deckbuilding, allowing for searching of cards by words that appear on them.

Legends of Runeterra
1. What did you find easy to use/intuitive in the app?

+ Saving decks was pretty intuitive, very obviously labled buttons for naming and saving
+ Deck building itself was very intuitive, cards could be dragged exactly as expected
+ Big blue action button was intuitive, communicated that if it was interacted with something would happen with the game state.

2. What features did you find to be difficult/less intuitive to use?

+ Deck building was difficult to figure out how to get to
+ Playing and using cards was unintuitive, didn’t understand what to do or how to do it with the cards
+ Didn’t understand what numbers on cards and in game to be tracking by default, had to be told
+ Stylized menus were not easily understood to be interactable, 
3D buttons were unexpected in menus, associated that with being part of the game
+ Menu color choice communicated non functionality(Brown)
+ Didn’t like all the little menu buttons and sub menus
+ Images should be used sparingly in button design

3. What were your thoughts on the card design? Did they communicate information about the game effectively?

+ Numbers on cards were obvious as important, rest not so much
+ Illustrations did effectively communicate what was a unit card vs what was a spell or equipment

4. Were there any standout features? What made them more noticeable than other features in the menus?

+ Big turn button was good, not meshing with aesthetic of the rest of the screen but not clashing too hard

5. If you could change one thing about the menus, what would it be and why?

+ Isolate the interactable elements to either the center or one side of the menu, dont have interactables all over the place.

Personas
1. Steven Pallson
+ Steven has been playing TCGs and CCGs since he was in middle school, but has always played physically, never online. He is a frequent user of the internet, however, often using it to purchase cards online or keep up with interesting looking decks and events in the games he plays. Recently he has become a father, and has had less and less time to go to the physical events he loves going to, and as such has turned to playing his favorite games online. He's not thrilled about this turn of events, as one of his favorite parts of going to physical events was socializing with other card game enjoyers. On top of this, he wasn't much of a gamer outside of his card games, so he's finding the transition to online a little more difficult than someone with plenty of experience playing video games.

2. Blaine Fife
+ Blaine loves video games, and often plays them with his friends after he gets home from high school. He's somewhat familiar with TCGs, as he used to collect Pokemon cards in elementary school, but mainly did it just because he liked looking at the cards. Recently, some of his friends picked up Hearthstone and have been playing it together a lot. Blaine didn't think it was really his kind of game, and as such hadn't joined them, but recently, it seems like thats the only thing any of his friends are playing so he's finally caved and decided to try to pick it up. He's trying to teach himself how to play, and while he can breeze through the menus, hes struggling to learn general gameplay and what is and is not important when making a deck.

Brainstorming
SCAMPER method

Substitute: Currently the buttons in my game menu are just text that gets a background when hovered over. Maybe instead of this, make them have backgrounds that light up when hovered to communicate interactivity.

Combine: This game will eventually have multiplayer features, and while I had originally envisioned all of stuff like a messages tab, an invites tab, and an announcements tab as different buttons, it may be better to combine them into a singular button. This would open up a menu with multiple tabs for each of these features, as well as have a general feed for all of them upon opening the menu.

Adapt: Lots of feedback has been given indicating that searching for cards in deck-building is difficult even for experienced players if they are not familiar with cards by name. Therefore, in the search feature for my deckbuilder, I intend to expand the search function to not just search by card name, but to also by text on the card. While some deckbuilders do have this feature, it largely only works for single words, not word chains.

Modify/minify/magnify: While it is nice to have a labelled settings button, someone who is even mildly competent at using computers would have little difficulty identifying a little button with a gear in it as a settings button, so I'll probably change it to that to give the other buttons more screen space.

Put to Another Use: My menu's dont have a ton of features right now outside of the ability to enter and exit them, so there's not much to retool. For some of the games I've played though I enjoy their sidebar menu design so I might retool it for the submenu's that I'm designing right now for my game.

Eliminate: Again, my menu's currently don't have a lot of stuff to interact with so there's not a lot to eliminate, however, one complaint I saw almost uniformly across the games I interviewed about was a lack of understanding what could and could not be done with cards in hand. Therefore, outside of the ability to zoom in on them, I would eliminate the ability to interact with any card that could not be played, to hopefully avoid that conclusion.
